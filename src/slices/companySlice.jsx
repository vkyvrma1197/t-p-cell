// Slice:-
    // In the context of React, specifically when using Redux Toolkit, a "slice" refers to a
    // portion of the Redux state and the associated logic to handle that state. A slice typically
    // includes a piece of state, the reducers to update that state, and the actions that can be
    // dispatched to trigger those reducers.
    

    // Key Components of a Slice
    // State: The initial state for this slice of the Redux store.
    // Reducers: Functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions.
    // Actions: Automatically generated action creators based on the reducers.
